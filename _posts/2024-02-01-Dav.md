 ```

We get this directory known as `/weddav`  
![](../assets/img/try_hack_me/Easy/Dav/3.png))

Here i need a username and password.  
Did some research and got this default credentials.  
![](../assets/img/try_hack_me/Easy/Dav/4.png))

User = `wampp`  
pass = `xampp`  
Entering the credentials i get a file `passwd.dav`file.  
![](../assets/img/try_hack_me/Easy/Dav/5.png))

`=wampp:$apr1$Wm2VTkFL$PVNRQv7kzqXQIHe14qKA91`
Cracked the hash but got nothing much.  

I searched for web-dav vulnerability and got that we can upload files to it's server.  
I think if I can upload the shell and connect to it we can login into the system easily.  

I used a php reverse shell , changed the ip and uploaded it  
```sh
curl --user "wamp:xamp" http://10.10.127.205/webdev/ --upload-file reverseshell.php -v
```

Run nc cat on my machine then run the code.  
Got the shell and stabilized it.

Now it's just a matter of looking for the `user.txt `

# Privilege Escalation
For this i always first run  
- `sudo -l`
- cat `/etc/crontab`

## sudo -l

This was simple since the user can read any file with `sudo` without a password.
