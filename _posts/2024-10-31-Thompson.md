On clicking server Status we got a prompt asking us to enter the username and the password.  
I tried “admin:admin” though it was wrong it took me to a page that gave me the default credentials.

username  `tomcat`
password  `s3cret`

Logged in successfully but there as not much in the Server status so i proceeded into the manager App
Here i found this:

### privilege escalation

Here we see a file that executes as root and feeds its output to the text file.    
let's check crontab for more info .  
![](/assets/img/Thompson/6.png)  

So this file runs as root and is scheduled .  
We shall add some commands to it .  

```sh
echo “cat /root/root.txt” >> id.sh
```

Now we wait for the root to run the file then we can read the flag from the text file.
