# Web Challenges

##  Chiti
`Chiti` is a very easy web challenge.We start off by getting a hint in the source code  shifting our focus to the `robots.txt` file and we get the flag.

Other than the poetic description we don't get much from the challenge description.Let's visit the site:
![image](https://gist.github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4a2a044-7f0a-490f-84b0-3fdc431ac166)

The site is a static web page for a car selling company but viewing the source code we get a html comment that's promising:
![image](https://gist.github.com/user-attachments/assets/135feb0f-7839-4071-babf-34d6e4bbd39a)
Decoding the `base64` we get:
```bash

echo -n IEkgYW0gbm90IGEgcm9ib3QhISEg | base64 -d
I am not a robot!!! 

```

From this we can deduce that we are needed to visit the `robots.txt` file.

> [!NOTE]
>  A robots.txt file **tells search engine crawlers which URLs the crawler can access on your site**.

Viewing the file we get our flag.

But this doesn't look like our normal flag format, for quick decoding lets use [cyberchef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) that will identify the encoding and give use the decoded text.
![image](https://gist.github.com/user-attachments/assets/04b00570-cfd8-4adc-9ccd-f77662671bcb)

flag : `csk{R0b0ts_Ar3_H3lpful}`
Solving this challenge unlocks the next challenge.

## Truth Lies
Here is another much simpler web challenge that was unlocked after solving the previous one `chiti` .In `Truth Lies` we are redirected too the `/dashboard` page that we got from the `robots.txt` file ,the dashboard displays a static login page but viewing the source code we get the encoded flag.

![image](https://gist.github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5b915e0-766b-440f-acdb-a3fccdfcd1b1)

The link redirects us to this login page:
![image](https://gist.github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f44773f-2bb6-450d-85cc-ae97cd5d7a4c)

The login page does't post any requests lets view the source code to understand it better:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title></title>
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="[/assets/css/dashboard.css](view-source:https://carvilla-one.vercel.app/assets/css/dashboard.css)">

</head>
<body>
	<h1>Admin Log in </h1>
	<div class="log">
        <form >
            <label for="uname">User Name:</label>
            <input type="text" name="uname"	JN4VKSDBMNVXG62MGAYGWX2EGMZXAMLOOQYF6QZQMQZX2=== required><br><br>
            <label for="password">Password:</label>
            <input type="password" name="password" required><br><br>
            <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Log In">
        </form>
        
	</div>
</body>
</html>
```

Before we do further code review let try decoding the text that catches our eyes at a glance;

Flag : `KyUHacks{L00k_D33p1nt0_C0d3}`


## Matters logic
In this challenge we shall be exploiting an `sql injection`  vulnerability to by-pass the authentication on the login page the only challenge is getting a valid username.

> Hint : log in as the SU

Visiting the website.
![image](https://gist.github.com/user-attachments/assets/59407eda-201c-4e31-b4dd-a7bd14fc8425)

This time the login page is not static, we can try authenticating but for that we need a valid `username` and a `password` or find some other way to bypass it, like `sql injection` .
From the hint and some search we learn that `SU` refers to `Super User` , in website the user with this super privileges is the `admin`.
Now that we have a username to go with lets try some `sql injection` queries.
payload : `admin'-- -`
![image](https://gist.github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba7307f9-0ed6-482b-af3c-4f442f4bab60)

As usual we are getting an encoded flag lets visit [cyberchef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) and decode the text:
![image](https://gist.github.com/user-attachments/assets/0da277cd-58b5-4a48-8ce6-cfa3a8ee3c81)

flag : `Meru{D4t4b4s3_0wn3d!}`
The challenge unlocks another challenge.



## Mighty Sword
In `Mighty Sword` we shall be exploiting an `XSS` vulnerability but we cant use the alert() function thus we have to search for alternative functions also the flag decode part is tricky :) 

![image](https://gist.github.com/user-attachments/assets/47c5363d-3d46-445d-a1f4-38f03c3c713c)

> Challenge description :  The pen is mightier than the sword, but can your words summon an alert from the shadows?
> Hint : Alert Alternatives :)


The link redirects us to the admin dashboard :
![image](https://gist.github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb2320b0-4c25-4f7f-8aa0-4730a4fa1903)

Here we are congratulated an requested to leave a comment. From the challenge description we can guess it's  a `xss`  vulnerability that we can exploiti using the basic alert script `<script>alert("Pwnus")</script>` .But the hint warns us that we should use alert alternative functions . Some googling and we get the `prompt()` and the `print()` Lets craft our payloads:
```javascript
<script>print("Pwnus")</script>
<script>prompt("Pwnus")</script>
```

Using the payloads we get the encoded flag

`Cyberchef` to the rescue :)
Decoding was the hard part since one needed to know the rotate amounts but since  the previous challenge was `ROT13` i used ROT13 Brute force and got the flag.
![image](https://gist.github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d5a78ad-478c-453b-98b6-d7b01d390800)

flag : `Meru{Scr1pt1ng_G0n3_W1ld}` 

Thanks for reading my writeup, this was my ctf's to create hope you enjoyed and feel free to connect and let's pwn more :)  #pwnus
